# Notebooks folder

This folder contains the Jupyter notebooks, which are used to visualise and analyse the results of the alignments. The function call for the OpenCADD alignments is also present in the notebooks, but commented out to avoid accidental calls. 
The paths for this call need to be adjusted if used.

The Early_Results_TK notebook represents the results of the first two stages of the benchmark including the results of the alignments by MDA with different parameters for the sequence alignment.
The early results are shown for the TK sample set.

The refinement notebooks show the results, when the refinement for PyMol align is used.
This is exemplary performed for the within-group alignments of the TK sample and the between-groups alignments of the Tk and CAMK samples.

The Acquire_samples notebook was used to query the KLIFS database and to create the four sample sets used in the bachelor thesis.
